## Game Rules

Introduction

This board game is designed for people who experience difficulties in communication, shyness, or social phobia. It helps, in a safe and playful way, to live through different social situations, better understand oneself and others, and practice expressing thoughts and feelings.

The game is designed as a form of group cognitive therapy but can also be used as a gentle psychological practice among friends.

What is Social Phobia?

Social phobia is an anxiety disorder in which a person finds it difficult to interact with others: to speak in public, to make new acquaintances, to stand up for their opinion, or to be the center of attention. A person fears criticism, judgment, or embarrassment.
In the game, these difficulties are represented as sea creatures who must also make their way from the deep sea to the shore — toward light, air, and freedom.

What is Group Cognitive Therapy?

Group cognitive therapy is a method of psychological support in which people with similar problems gather together, share their experiences, try out new ways of behavior, and receive support.
The game format helps to reduce tension, express one’s thoughts through characters, and take steps toward overcoming fears.

Characters
🐡 Panicked Speaker (Pufferfish)

Afraid of public speaking. Whenever it needs to say something, it “inflates” with nervousness and seems larger than its fears.
Problem: fear of speaking in front of others and being heard.
Goal: to learn to express oneself without excessive tension.

🦀 The Fugitive (Crab)

Always runs away from problems, hiding in its “aquarium-home.” Avoids new situations to escape anxiety.
Problem: avoidance of communication and isolation.
Goal: to try stepping out of the “shell” and face the world.

🐬 The Clown (Dolphin)

A master of masks. Cheerful and playful in public but hides true emotions deep inside.
Problem: difficulty being authentic around others.
Goal: to learn to show real feelings and personal traits.

🐟 Invisible (Flounder)

Blends into the environment, trying not to be noticed.
Problem: fear of contact and a sense of being “invisible.”
Goal: to learn to show up and find one’s place among others.

🐍 Writer (Eel)

Knowledgeable, thoughtful, and writes a lot. But hides wisdom and rarely shares it in real life.
Problem: able to express thoughts only in writing, not in conversation.
Goal: to learn to share the inner world directly with others.

How to Play
Goal of the Game

Climb from the depths of the sea to the shore by answering questions and sharing experiences.
On the way, you will pass through three stages:

The Depths (levels 1–3) — simple, safe questions.

The Shallows (levels 4–6) — medium-level questions that require more personal input.

The Shore (levels 7–9) — personal questions about feelings, thoughts, and experiences.

Setup

Each player chooses a character that reflects their real-life struggle.

Draw cards with questions related to the chosen character.

Game Turn

A player draws a card and answers the question.

If they are not ready to answer, they may skip the turn and remain on the same level.

After the response, all players vote: whose answer was the most open and sincere? The winner receives a starfish — an additional point.

Winning

The first player to reach the shore finishes the path.

The winner is the one who reaches the shore and has the most starfish.

💡 The game is not about competition but about experience: each step and each answer is movement toward freedom from fears and finding support in others.
